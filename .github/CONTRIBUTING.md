# Contributing to NIGHTFRAME

This project follows a strict technical contribution workflow.

## Development Standards

1.  **Code Style**: Adhere to standard C# and TypeScript formatting. Use `.editorconfig` where available.
2.  **Commit Messages**: Use imperative, technical descriptions (e.g., `Implement LSTM handover logic`, `Fix gRPC stream timeout`). Avoid emojis or non-technical language.
3.  **Testing**: All pull requests must include relevant unit or integration tests where applicable.
4.  **Documentation**: Update READMEs and technical specifications when introducing new modules or breaking changes.

## Pull Request Process

1.  Open an issue to discuss significant architectural changes.
2.  Create a feature branch from `main`.
3.  Ensure the `.github/workflows/build.yml` passes locally or in your fork.
4.  Submit PR with a clear summary of changes and reference any related issues.
