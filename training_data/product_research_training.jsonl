{"prompt": "What is NIGHTFRAME's security hardening approach?", "completion": "NIGHTFRAME implements defense-in-depth security with multiple layers: file system protection using OS-level ACLs and DPAPI encryption, anti-debug measures that detect and respond to debugger attachment, code integrity verification using SHA-256 hashes, and secure memory handling with SecureClear methods that overwrite sensitive data before freeing it."}
{"prompt": "How does P2P relay chain work in NIGHTFRAME?", "completion": "P2P relay chains enable multi-hop internet connectivity. When a user connects to a NIGHTFRAME hotspot that lacks direct internet, traffic is relayed through a chain of nodes until reaching one with internet access. Maximum 5 hops are allowed, with path discovery preferring shorter paths and lower latency."}
{"prompt": "What is the late-stage propagation scenario?", "completion": "Late-stage propagation occurs when users without internet connect to NFRAME SSID and get connectivity through multi-hop relay chains. The system validates this by checking for direct internet connectivity, healthy relay paths, and end-to-end traffic flow capability."}
{"prompt": "How does SSID broadcast work across platforms?", "completion": "On Windows, NIGHTFRAME uses the hosted network API (netsh wlan). On Linux, it uses hostapd with nl80211 driver. On macOS, it requires manual Internet Sharing setup. The default SSID 'NFRAME Global Internet' is chosen to be immediately understandable to potential users."}
{"prompt": "What device compatibility does NIGHTFRAME ensure?", "completion": "NIGHTFRAME tests compatibility with iOS (iPhone/iPad), Android (all versions), Windows, macOS, and Linux. iOS and Android use captive portal detection which automatically opens the browser. SSID encoding is validated to stay within the 1-32 byte UTF-8 limit."}
{"prompt": "What are the WiFi security protocols used?", "completion": "For guests, NIGHTFRAME uses open networks with captive portal for minimal friction. For authenticated mesh members, WPA2/WPA3 with pre-shared keys. 802.11w (Management Frame Protection) is enabled where supported to prevent deauthentication attacks."}
{"prompt": "What factors build user trust in the portal?", "completion": "Trust is built through professional visual design (cohesive colors, smooth animations), explicit trust badges ('No Tracking', 'Open Source'), transparency about data usage, showing limits (which suggests sustainable infrastructure), and progressive disclosure that respects users' time."}
{"prompt": "How does progressive disclosure work in the portal?", "completion": "Progressive disclosure presents information in layers: simple call-to-action first ('Get Connected'), then expandable 'How it works' section, then full terms on a separate page. This respects users' time while still providing full transparency for those who want it."}
{"prompt": "What are the hard-coded resource limits?", "completion": "The ResourceLimits class enforces: 50 GB monthly bandwidth, 20% CPU, 512 MB RAM, 30% GPU, 1 GB disk cache, and 90-day session log retention. Users can reduce but not increase these limits through the /settings page."}
{"prompt": "How does guest speed throttling work?", "completion": "Guests (non-members) are limited to 512 Kbps. This is enough for basic browsing, messaging, and low-quality video streaming, but not torrenting or HD streaming. The limit protects operators while providing genuine value to guests."}
{"prompt": "How can users revoke consent?", "completion": "Users can revoke consent at any time through the /settings portal page. This immediately disables sharing with no waiting period. The system then runs in receive-only mode - still able to access NFRAME hotspots but not providing one."}
{"prompt": "What is the consent flow psychology?", "completion": "The 4-point consent flow pairs scary disclosures with mitigations: instead of 'Traffic uses your bandwidth' (scary), we say 'Traffic uses your bandwidth, but you control the limit - default 50GB' (reassuring). Progress indicators encourage completion."}
{"prompt": "How does anti-debug protection work?", "completion": "NIGHTFRAME detects debuggers through multiple methods: .NET Debugger.IsAttached, Windows IsDebuggerPresent API, and timing analysis. When detected, it doesn't crash but switches to 'limited mode' where sensitive operations are disabled or return dummy data."}
{"prompt": "How does file system protection work?", "completion": "On Windows, ACLs restrict file access to current user only. DPAPI encrypts sensitive data at rest, tied to Windows credentials. On Unix, permissions are set to 600 for files and 700 for directories. These protect identity keys and session databases."}
{"prompt": "What is code integrity verification?", "completion": "At startup, NIGHTFRAME computes SHA-256 hash of its executable. Periodic checks verify this hasn't changed. Modified binaries indicate tampering. Combined with code signing, this provides assurance the running code is legitimate."}
{"prompt": "How does secure memory handling work?", "completion": "SecureClear methods overwrite byte arrays with random data before zeroing them. The SecureBytes wrapper class automatically clears contents on disposal. Garbage collection is forced after sensitive operations to reduce recovery windows."}
{"prompt": "What is the relay path discovery algorithm?", "completion": "When a node starts without direct internet, it scans for nearby NFRAME networks, connects to each, and queries relay capability. If a neighbor has internet or knows a path, a relay path is established. The algorithm prefers shorter paths and lower latency."}
{"prompt": "How does relay chain health monitoring work?", "completion": "The system performs periodic health checks on all active paths, verifying each hop is healthy and recently seen. If paths fail, the system discovers new ones. Validation ensures users connecting to NFRAME hotspots will actually get connectivity."}
{"prompt": "What trust badges does NIGHTFRAME use?", "completion": "The portal displays trust badges: '🔒 No Tracking', '🌐 Open Source', '⚡ Instant Connect'. These aren't just marketing - they're verifiable claims that set user expectations and build trust through explicit commitment statements."}
{"prompt": "Why do limits build trust?", "completion": "Counterintuitively, showing limits like '512 Kbps for guests' is more trustworthy than 'unlimited speed'. Limits suggest sustainable infrastructure and honest communication. Unlimited promises suggest either lies or future service degradation."}
{"prompt": "What is the settings page functionality?", "completion": "The /settings portal page lets users view current limits (bandwidth, CPU, RAM, GPU), see usage statistics with progress bars, reduce limits (but not increase beyond hard caps), and revoke consent to disable sharing."}
{"prompt": "How does NIGHTFRAME protect against government surveillance?", "completion": "Defense in depth makes attacks expensive: file encryption with DPAPI, OS-level access controls, anti-debug measures, code integrity verification, and secure memory handling. While not invulnerable, the goal is making targets not worth the effort."}
